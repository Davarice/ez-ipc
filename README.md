# EZ-IPC

Interprocess Communication, Easily.

I dont know what Im doing.

---

The goal of this Library is to simplify IPC, possibly networked, as much as possible. A Host instance of the program will listen for connections, accept connections from Client instances of the program, and then allow for the transfer of Python data via JSON.

As a developer with a long standing aversion to anything networking, I will be learning the basics while building this. I have no idea what limitations will be involved, but still I intend the Library to be as accessible, and also secure, as I can possibly make it.

Due to my inexperience, any and all data transferred by way of this Library should be considered compromised. Do not use it for anything sensitive.
